# Get started!
Access the Guide: Head to the Sports Injury Repository. Click the green "Code" button, then "Download ZIP" to your local computer.

Organize Your Files: Locate this folder in your downloads and move it to a secure place where you can manage your files and other assets like images, PDFs, etc.

Open a Text Editor: Download and/or open a text editor like Notepad++ or VSCode.

Review the Content: Use the text editor to open the index.html documents and style.css from your project folder.

Customization: Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own webtext!

Publish: Once you've modified and added your files to your project file, you'll want to publish it to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext.

Upload Your Files: Click "uploading an existing file" and "commit" your file changes to this repository. Remember, you'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly.

Finalize the Setup: Go to your repository "**settings**." Scroll down to "**Pages**" and change the setting from "**none**" to "**main**" branch. Hit "**Save**". This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

Test Your URL: Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
